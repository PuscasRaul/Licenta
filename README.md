My bachelor's thesis project - building a car plate recognition server with client.
Currently working on the core components:

Custom neural network implementation in C
Matrix math library and n-dimensional arrays
Memory management with arena allocators
Logging system

Still in development. The plan is to have a server that can recognize license plates and a client to interact with it.
